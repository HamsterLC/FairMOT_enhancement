# FairMOT_enhancement

This repo is an enhancement version of FairMOT(joint detection+reid), detection algorithm use ATSS/PAA. The algorithm is using mmdetection2.
We also provided python code to convert the orgin label to CoCo.
Due to high accuracy detection result, this model is more powerful than the origin FairMOT by using lightweight backbone.
